# Christopher Alexander

## Notes About Alexander's Thought
> 1/n There's one overarching meta algorithm that he has worked on his whole life,  roughly described as "unfolding"
> It could be thought of as a design algorithm, but in fact the deeper you go, the more *all thought* seems to become a form of design;
> 2/n "Unfolding" has been further broken down into the application of fifteen "structure preserving transformations" which are more particular,  yet still operate at a fairly high level of abstraction;
> 3/n even those fifteen more algorithmic "transformations" feel more like broad CLASSES of algorithm -
> So he's working at a superstructure level for sure
> But I find his framing REALLY helpful to remind myself not to get "lost in the weeds"
> An eternal reminder of the big picture
> SCALE is one of the things we must attend to.
