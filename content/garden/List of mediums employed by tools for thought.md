# List of mediums employed by tools for thought
These are not features, but rather [[Medium for thinking]] that are present in tools which help us manage knowledge.

- Prose text
- Outline or List
- Graph of connected ideas (knowledge graphs, mind maps, etc)
- Table (i.e., spreadsheets)
- Spatial Canvas
- Timeline
- Hierarchy (Nested folders)
- Tags
- Schemas
- Annotations of other material

We actually understand the primitives pretty darn well. What we don’t understand is how to organize the primitives into a larger structure.

Also don’t understand how to scale these primitives to organization-scale knowledge management.

What we *don’t* have as primitives, but we should:
- Programs
- Simulations
