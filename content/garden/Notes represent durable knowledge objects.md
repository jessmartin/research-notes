# Notes represent durable knowledge objects
Each note should be focused on making a single claim, or representing a single idea. Distinct ideas should be linked to one another using hyperlinks. Notes forgo any descriptive narrative, unless narrative is useful in strengthening the claim.

I publish [articles](https://jessmart.in/writings/) separately from this lab notebook. A note is not an article. Articles allows me liberty with narrative, rhetoric, and format. They are probably more fun, and these notes are probably a bit dry. The dryness is intentional. I'm attempting to use clear, uninflected language to precisely describe the contours of an idea.
