# Computers should enable robust collaborative experiences
By collaboration, I mean humans and computers interacting with one another, bringing together individualized skills and knowledge to accomplish a shared goal.

Systems that allow humans to collaborate on work products at the same time are of critical importance in tackling the complexity inherent in the world. Furthermore, working collaboratively with others is one of the greatest joys in life, and the creation of systems that support robust collaborative experiences is a valuable end unto itself.

[[Collaboration is a spectrum from asynchronous to fully synchronous.]] For the past several decades we have developed sophisticated systems for asynchronous collaboration (git, Kanban, email, etc). Due to a variety of factors, fully synchronous collaboration has been under-explored. We are just now developing technologies and applications that enable rich synchronous collaboration experiences.

See [[List of Software Tools for Collaboration Experiences]].
