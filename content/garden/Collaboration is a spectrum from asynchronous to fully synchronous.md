# Collaboration is a spectrum from asynchronous to fully synchronous.
From fully asynchronous work to fully synchronous work, there is actually a spectrum of possible working styles.

- full async - no collaboration ever - has to be completely disconnected
- async branching - git flow, working in parallel universes temporarily, then merging back together
- peripheral awareness - working in the same space while working separately (parallel play)
- fully sync - pair programming
