# Learning
My personal definition of learning: 
You know something when you can recall and apply the knowledge in an appropriate context.

Simpler version:
S understands knowledge K if S uses K whenever appropriate.
-J. Moore and A. Newell

## Recall
Learning requires that you remember the thing you've learned. There is an element of rote memorization to this.

If you don't remember it, you can't hope to apply it.

## Apply
Learning is only useful when it allows for application of knowledge. Rarely does recall of the "fact" alone do any good. Application of the knowledge to the situation at hand requires deeper understanding.

## In an appropriate context
If you can't use the knowledge when it's time to use it, what's the point? Also, application of knowledge is always situational. 

Learning the topic in context is helpful here: you're more likely to recognize an appropriate context in the future.

## Durability
"Recall and apply appropriately" is at the heart of "durability" in learning.

Durable learning sticks around. It doesn't vanish after a few weeks. It surfaces almost automatically when the time is right.
