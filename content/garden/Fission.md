# Fission
I've spent the day muddling through the high-level "what is Fission" and the low-level of "what are these individual technologies and how do they fit together" questions.

Here's a quick document I put together 
---
Fission is a frontier-tech organization founded by [[Boris Mann]] and [[Brooklyn Zalenka]].

Their main mandate is to improve the way the web works by building core technology, protocols, and products that enable the web3 ideals of decentralization, privacy-preservation, and permissionless building.

They are expending their effort in 3 directions
- Decentralized Web Stack - authentication, file storage, database, etc
- IPFS Core Infra Improvements
- Laconic - Blockchain Data Availability Layer

Company is trying to figure out broadly what _kind_ of organization they are going to be. How will they make money? What will their products be? Who will their clients be?

Right now, they are in the phase of doing lots of experimentation.

Products
Platforms
Protocols

The goal was always to build new kinds of products, or at least platforms that could enable new kinds of products. But the underlying protocols needed to be invented in order to enable these new platforms.

What's the shape of the new web?

How might we engage product companies and what kind of platforms might we build on these new "web native" primitives.

How might organizations interface in this new world?
