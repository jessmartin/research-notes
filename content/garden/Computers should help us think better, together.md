# Computers should help us think better, together
I believe the computer is a [[Medium for thinking]]. My goal is to make the computer a more expressive medium so that humans and computers can think better, together.

Notes on what "think better" might mean, from [[Eric Burns]]:
> - Enable greater surety that participants share the same mental model (minimize miscommunications) 
> - Enable participants to reach conclusions more quickly (i.e. we humans would have gotten there eventually, but the computer took some sort of grunt work out of it ... early examples would be the need to add a large number of numbers together ... the computer helps the participants get to the conclusion more quickly ... it would be interesting to explore more complex ways that computers can do this for us today ... and/or tomorrow)
> - Create greater persistence of conclusions (how many times have you gotten out of a meeting and thought, "Hmm ... I wish I had taken better notes. What I though was clear in the meeting has slipped out of my mind ... I'm lost again")
> - Is there maybe a space of reasoning that humans just can't get to on their own because of a lack of working memory to understand a very high-dimension problem? I'm not sure that there is (assuming we have access to conventional means to store thoughts that we would otherwise forget). But maybe?
> - Help validate a line of reasoning (e.g. identify reasoning errors, etc)
> - Help people identify areas where their thinking needs refinement (e.g. an automated tool that would have asked you "what do you mean by better?")
